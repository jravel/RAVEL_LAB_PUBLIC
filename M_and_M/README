the log10 relative abundance of M. curtisii/mulieris and S. sanguinegens in all
subjects and AA. Corresponding volcano plots.

Fig 1(E)
Kaplan-Meier survival plot for BVAB3, M. curtisii/mulieris and S.
sanguinegens in all and AA women who harbor these bacterial taxa at relative
abundance below (blue) or above (orange) the threshold values above which the
risk of sPTB is significant different from baseline.

outcomes and vaginal community state types.

Risk of sPTB at visit 1 in AA women vs beta-defensins quartiles within samples
where selected five bacterial taxa were detected.

Fig 3
Interactions between beta-defensins, Lactobacillus spp. relative
abundance, M. curtisii/mulieris relative abundance, vaginal community state
types and pregnancy outcomes in AA women at visit 1. Each woman who went on to
deliver preterm is represented by a triangle, while those who delivered at term
by a square. Large and small triangles or squares are colored by CSTs and
indicate relative abundances of M. curtisii/mulieris above and below its
threshold value, respectively, as defined in Fig. 1. beta-defensins
concentrations and Lactobacillus spp. relative abundances were stratified into
tertiles. The color of each quadrant indicates the proportion of sPTBs (number
of sPTB/total births).
